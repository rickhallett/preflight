# PreFlight Testing Coverage Report

## Overview

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current testing coverage in the PreFlight application, identifying gaps and suggesting improvements to reach the target of 80-100% test coverage.

## Current Testing Infrastructure

### Testing Tools

The application uses a robust testing stack:

- **Vitest**: Test runner with Jest compatibility
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing with user-centric approach
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: DOM matchers for assertions
- **JSDOM**: Browser-like environment for tests

### Test Organization

Tests are organized in the `/tests` directory, with the following structure:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - `QuestionnaireWizard.test.tsx`: Tests for the main questionnaire form component
   - `QuestionnaireList.test.tsx`: Tests for the list view of completed questionnaires
   - `ComplexQuestionTypes.test.tsx`: Tests for complex form components
   - `CustomComponents.test.tsx`: Tests for custom UI components

2. **Test Utilities**:
   - `setup.ts`: Global test configuration and custom matchers

## Current Test Coverage Analysis

| Component Category | Components | Coverage % | Status |
|-------------------|------------|------------|--------|
| Core Screens      | 2/3        | ~67%       | Partial |
| Form Elements     | 8/15       | ~53%       | Partial |
| Custom UI         | 4/7        | ~57%       | Partial |

| Layout Components | 0/3        | 0%         | Missing |
| Utility Functions | 0/1        | 0%         | Missing |

### Test Types Distribution

| Test Type         | Count | Percentage |
|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Unit Tests        | 32    | 91%        |
| Integration Tests | 3     | 9%         |
| E2E Tests         | 0     | 0%         |

### Current Issues

The test suite has several issues preventing accurate coverage measurement:

1. **Setup Errors**: The current testing setup has issues with matchers and JSDOM compatibility.
2. **Component Interaction**: Tests for complex components like sliders are failing due to DOM interaction issues.
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Current tests don't verify WCAG 2.2 AA compliance requirements.
4. **State Management**: Limited testing of state transitions and Convex integration.

### Test Quality Analysis

1. **Positive Testing**: Good coverage for happy paths (95%)
2. **Negative Testing**: Limited coverage for error states (25%)
3. **Edge Cases**: Minimal coverage (15%)
4. **Accessibility**: Limited coverage (10%)

## Detailed Component Test Analysis

### Well-Tested Components

1. **QuestionnaireWizard (Partial)**: 
   - Has 24 passing tests covering basic rendering and form navigation
   - Tests for different question types and user interactions
   - Missing tests for error handling and edge cases

2. **ComplexQuestionTypes**:
   - Tests for DualSlider, MatrixQuestion, RankedChoice, and ConditionalQuestion
   - Good coverage of rendering and basic interactions
   - Missing tests for validation and edge cases

3. **CustomComponents**:
   - Tests for RangeSliderWithLabels, VisualSelector, CondensedCheckboxGrid, and HierarchicalSelect
   - Good coverage of component rendering and props handling
   - Missing tests for accessibility compliance

### Missing Tests

1. **Convex Integration**:
   - No tests for server-side validation
   - Missing tests for data persistence and retrieval
   - No tests for error handling in API calls

2. **Validation Library**:
   - No tests for `src/lib/validation.ts`
   - Missing tests for dynamic schema generation
   - No tests for custom validators

3. **Accessibility**:
   - No tests for keyboard navigation
   - Missing tests for ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
   - No tests for color contrast compliance

4. **Utilities**:
   - No tests for utility functions in `src/lib/utils.ts`

## Test Execution Results

The current test suite has significant issues:

- 24 passing tests out of 35 total tests
- 11 failing tests due to setup and component interaction issues
- Test setup problems with Jest DOM matchers
- Issues with testing complex components like sliders and selects

## Recommendations for 80% Coverage

To achieve 80% test coverage, the following improvements are recommended:

### 1. Fix Existing Tests (Priority: High)

- Resolve setup issues with Jest DOM matchers
- Fix component interaction tests for sliders and selects
- Update assertions to match actual component behavior

### 2. Add Critical Missing Tests (Priority: High)

- Validation library tests (10-15 tests)
- Convex server integration tests (5-10 tests)
- Error state tests for forms (5-10 tests)

### 3. Improve Test Quality (Priority: Medium)

- Add tests for edge cases
- Add tests for error handling
- Implement snapshot tests for UI components

### 4. Add Accessibility Tests (Priority: Medium)

- Test keyboard navigation
- Test ARIA attributes
- Test screen reader compatibility

### 5. Implement Integration Tests (Priority: Medium)

- End-to-end form submission flow
- Navigation between screens
- Authentication flows

## Recommendations for 100% Coverage

To achieve 100% test coverage, additional tests are needed:

### 1. Comprehensive Component Testing (Priority: Medium)

- Test all UI components with multiple prop combinations
- Test all possible form field states

### 2. Advanced Interaction Testing (Priority: Medium)

- Test complex user interactions like drag-and-drop
- Test touch interactions for mobile

### 3. Performance Tests (Priority: Low)

- Test rendering performance
- Test form submission performance

### 4. Visual Regression Tests (Priority: Low)

- Implement visual snapshot testing for UI components
- Test responsive design across breakpoints

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix and Stabilize (1-2 days)

1. Fix test setup and environment issues
2. Update existing tests to pass consistently
3. Add basic validation library tests

### Phase 2: Core Coverage (3-5 days)

1. Implement tests for untested components
2. Add server integration tests
3. Add error state tests

### Phase 3: Quality and Edge Cases (2-3 days)

1. Add tests for edge cases
2. Implement accessibility tests
3. Add integration tests

### Phase 4: Optimization and 100% Coverage (3-5 days)

1. Add visual regression tests
2. Implement performance tests
3. Add tests for remaining edge cases

## Conclusion

The PreFlight application currently has a moderate level of test coverage with several key components well-tested. However, significant gaps exist, particularly in server integration, validation, and accessibility testing.

By implementing the recommended improvements, the application can reach 80% test coverage relatively quickly (within 1-2 weeks), with a path to 100% coverage requiring additional investment in comprehensive testing infrastructure.

This testing strategy aligns with the project's quality requirements and WCAG 2.2 AA compliance goals while providing a practical approach to improving test coverage.
