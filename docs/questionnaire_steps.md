Below is a *menu* of questionnaire steps you can drop into your app.  
I’ve grouped them into three tiers so you can start with the highest-leverage items and add the rest as your time and respondent goodwill allow.

---

## Tier 1 – **Crucial, high-leverage unknowns**  
Collect these first; they reveal what practitioners *don’t yet realise they need* and what solution-builders absolutely must know.

| # | Step name & purpose | Example prompt(s) | Suggested input |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Workflow Bottlenecks & Pain-Points** – surface latent problems AI could solve | “Walk me through the most time-consuming part of a typical patient visit.” | Long-text |
| 2 | **Available Data & Quality** – discover the raw material AI can use | “Which of these data types do you reliably capture? (checkboxes) → Rate overall data completeness (0-100 slider).” | Multi-select + slider |
| 3 | **Outcome-of-Interest / Success Metrics** – define what “good” looks like | “If an AI tool worked perfectly, which metric would you present to your CFO to prove its value?” | Short-text |
| 4 | **Integration Points** – map the technical hooks | “Which systems would this AI need to plug into? (EHR, PACS, scheduling, billing…)” | Checkbox list |
| 5 | **Regulatory & Compliance Constraints** – avoid immediate deal-breakers | “Does your organisation permit cloud processing of PHI? (Yes/No) → If no, explain.” | Radio + conditional text |
| 6 | **AI Literacy & Comfort Level** – tailor UX and training | “On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you explaining what a large language model is?” | Likert |
| 7 | **Privacy & Ethical Risk Tolerance** – shape guardrails | “Which of the following risks would prevent adoption? (misdiagnosis, data leakage, bias…)” | Multi-select |
| 8 | **Budget & Procurement Window** – decide feasibility & deployment pace | “Estimate the annual budget you could justify for this solution.” | Slider (e.g. £0–200 k) |
| 9 | **Decision-Making Roles** – know who must be convinced | “Who signs off on new clinical software purchases? (CMO, CIO, Practice owner…)” | Dropdown |
|10| **Patient-Population Characteristics & Equity Concerns** – uncover edge-cases | “Select all that apply: high non-English-speaking share, rural coverage, paediatrics…” | Multi-select |
|11| **Who (role) will own ongoing accuracy / bias monitoring after go-live?** → dropdown
|12| **How quickly must the team be alerted if AUROC drops by >5 %?** → slider
|13| **If an AI suggestion is wrong, who should be held responsible?** → multiple-choice + optional text
|14| **Rank how important it is that the AI can show a rationale you can present to patients.** → Likert

## Tier 2 – **Important, but you can delay if time is tight**

| # | Step name | Example prompt(s) | Input |
|---|---|---|---|
|11| Deployment Preference (cloud/on-prem/mobile) | Radio buttons |
|12| Training & Support Preferences | Checkbox list |
|13| Expected Time-to-Value | “In months, when should the AI show measurable ROI?” → number input |
|14| Interoperability Standards in Use (FHIR, HL7 v2, DICOM) | Multi-select |
|15| Data Governance Maturity | “We have a formal data steward program: Yes/Partially/No” | Likert |
|16| Change-Management Readiness | “Rate agreement: Our staff embraces new tech quickly.” | Likert |
|17| Feedback-Loop Preference (how the AI should learn from users) | Checkbox |
|18| Tele-health / Remote-Monitoring Plans | Radio + conditional text |
|19| High-Risk Scenarios That Keep You Up at Night | Multiple choice |
|20| Data-Labeling Capacity (for fine-tuning) | Slider 0-100 indicating % of staff time available |
|21| Which of these constraints apply? (GPU shortage, no VPN, legacy OS, etc.) | checkbox
|22| Is there an existing billing code or value-based contract that would fund this use-case? | radio + text
|23| Select the level of human sign-off you’d require for AI-generated content. | multiple choice

---

## Tier 3 – **Confirmatory / nice-to-have**

| # | Step name | Example prompt(s) | Input |
|---|---|---|---|
|21| Previous AI Experience | “Have you piloted any AI tools? Describe results.” | Long-text |
|22| Specialty-Specific Use-Cases | Dropdown (specialties) + text |
|23| UI/UX Preferences (dark mode, voice, mobile-first…) | Multi-select |
|24| Preferred Vendors / Tech Stack | Text |
|25| Patient-Engagement Feature Wishes (chatbots, appointment nudges) | Multi-select |
|26| Today, do you obtain explicit consent before using decision-support tools? | yes/no
|27| Can de-identified data be shared with external partners for model improvement? | Likert
|28| Are there funded upgrades (EHR version, cloud migration) within 12 months? | date picker

### How to use the ranking

* **Start with Tier 1** even if it means a shorter questionnaire; these responses uncover the “unknown unknowns” that will shape every subsequent decision.  
* **Add Tier 2** once you’re getting < 15 min completion time.  
* **Sprinkle Tier 3** only for segments that stay engaged, or when you’re validating a polished solution.

### Tips for implementation

1. **Adaptive flow:** use answers in Tier 1 to dynamically show/hide later steps, keeping the experience short for each respondent.  
2. **Mix input types:** long-text for rich qualitative pain-points, but sliders/likert for quick quantification.  
3. **Progress indicator & save-resume:** busy clinicians need to pause and come back.  
4. **Pilot with 3-5 practitioners first:** time each step, drop or merge anything causing friction.  
5. **Close the loop:** share aggregated insights back to participants to maintain trust and encourage future feedback rounds.

Feel free to reorder within tiers to suit your audience’s attention span, but resist removing Tier 1 items—they’re the foundation for building AI healthcare solutions that practitioners will actually adopt.
