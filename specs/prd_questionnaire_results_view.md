# Enhanced Questionnaire Results View

## Problem Statement

The current QuestionnaireList component provides only basic information about completed questionnaires, showing only the completion date without any details about the responses. Users have no way to review their answers or see a summary of their questionnaire results, limiting the utility of the application for reference and follow-up.

## Requirements

1. Create a detailed view of completed questionnaire responses
2. Implement a summary dashboard with key insights from responses
3. Allow users to export questionnaire results
4. Provide comparison between multiple questionnaires (if applicable)

## Implementation Details

### Questionnaire Detail View

1. Implement a new `QuestionnaireDetail` component that displays:
   - Complete questionnaire metadata (title, completion date, time taken)
   - All questions with their respective answers
   - Visual indicators for skipped questions
   - Categorized sections with collapsible interfaces

2. Add a "View Details" button to each questionnaire in the list view that opens this detailed view

### Response Summary Dashboard

Create a dashboard that presents:

1. Key statistics and insights based on questionnaire answers
2. Category-based summaries (using question categories from PRDs)
3. Visual representations of responses (charts, graphs)
4. Recommendations or next steps based on responses

Example implementation:

```jsx
<QuestionnaireSummary
  questionnaireId={questionnaireId}
  sections={[
    {
      title: "Overview",
      metrics: ["completionTime", "completionPercentage", "categoryBreakdown"]
    },
    {
      title: "Technical Readiness",
      questions: ["step-06", "step-25", "step-28"],
      visualizationType: "radar"
    },
    {
      title: "Budget & Timeline",
      questions: ["step-08", "step-17", "step-26"],
      visualizationType: "barChart"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

### Export Functionality

Implement export options for:
1. PDF report with formatted responses and insights
2. CSV/Excel export of raw response data
3. Email sharing with configurable content

## Success Criteria

1. Users can view all their questionnaire responses in a clear, organized interface
2. The summary dashboard provides meaningful insights based on responses
3. Export functionality works across all supported formats
4. UI is responsive and maintains accessibility standards
5. Users report high satisfaction with the results view
