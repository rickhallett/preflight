# PRD Implementation Consistency Audit

## Problem Statement

There are potential inconsistencies between the specifications in the PRD files and their actual implementations. As demonstrated with step-02, which required a multiselect with slider but was implemented only as a multiselect, other PRDs may have similar mismatches that could lead to functionality gaps.

## Requirements

1. Conduct a comprehensive audit of all 35 PRD files against their implementations
2. Identify and document all inconsistencies between PRDs and implementations
3. Create a remediation plan for each inconsistency
4. Implement a system to prevent future inconsistencies

## Implementation Details

### Audit Process

1. Create an audit spreadsheet with the following columns:
   - PRD ID
   - PRD Title
   - Specified Question Type
   - Implemented Question Type
   - Options Defined Correctly
   - Additional UI Requirements Met
   - Status (Compliant/Non-Compliant)
   - Notes/Remediation Plan

2. Programmatically compare:
   - `convex_step_type` in PRD with database record
   - `options` in PRD with database record
   - `ui_component_suggestion` with actual implementation

3. For non-compliant steps, determine the correct implementation based on:
   - PRD specifications
   - Acceptance criteria
   - User experience considerations

### Prevention System

1. Add validation to the seed script to compare PRD files with schema constraints
2. Implement automated tests that verify each step's UI rendering matches the PRD
3. Create a development workflow that requires PRD review before step implementation

## Success Criteria

1. 100% of PRD steps have consistent implementations
2. All special rendering cases (like multiselect_with_slider) are correctly implemented
3. Seed process validates PRD-implementation consistency
4. All inconsistencies are documented and resolved

## Timeline

- Audit: 2 days
- Remediation planning: 1 day
- Implementation of fixes: 3-5 days (depending on findings)
- Validation and testing: 2 days

## Dependencies

- Access to all PRD files
- Existing schema and UI components
